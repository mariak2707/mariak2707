## Hi there 👋
I'm currently a **Bachelor student** at EPFL. And learning programmation for chemistry. 
 I worked on a project called [Thermopred](https://github.com/May-db/ThermoPred) An interactive chemical modeling tool that predicts reaction outcomes and thermodynamic stability from hand-drawn molecular inputs. Check it out!
